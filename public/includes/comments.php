Both commercial and in your home, you can’t go wrong. Like a good mechanic, it’s nice to have an electrician for both problem times and creative times. - Tom Snyder";

The project was a 14 week project with a very large amount of electrical work underground and above ground. HA Electric worked on this project like true professionals. I would defiantly have them on any project I worked on again. - Edmond P Reynolds Jr. Superintendent, Klewin Construction Inc";
